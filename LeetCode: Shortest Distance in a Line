Question: Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.

          Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points. 
          
          Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.

          Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis? 
          
Answer:
   
        SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x-p2.x)) AS shortest 
        FROM point p1 join point p2 on p1.x != p2.x
